# Smart Contract
 - Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code.
 - The code and the agreements contained there exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. 
 - Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among anonymous parties without the need for a trusted third party.
 
### Application of Smart Contract in Finance

**Decentralized exchanges:** Smart contracts can be used to create decentralized exchanges, which allow users to trade assets directly with each other without the need for a central intermediary. 
**Peer-to-peer lending:** Smart contracts can be used to create peer-to-peer lending platforms, which allow borrowers to connect directly with lenders without the need for a bank or other financial institution. 
**Automated insurance:** Smart contracts can be used to create automated insurance contracts, which can automatically pay out claims when certain conditions are met.

### Application of Smart Contract in Healthcare

Smart contracts have the potential to improve the efficiency and security of the healthcare industry. For eg:

**Patient records:** Smart contracts can be used to create electronic health records that are secure, tamper-proof, and accessible to authorized personnel.
**Insurance claims:** Smart contracts can be used to automate the processing of insurance claims, which can reduce the time and hassle for patients and providers.
**Clinical trials:** Smart contracts can be used to manage the development and distribution of new medical treatments and therapies, which can help to ensure that clinical trials are conducted fairly and efficiently.

### Application of Smart Contract in Real estate

Smart contracts have the potential to streamline the real estate industry and make it more efficient and transparent. For eg:

**Property transfers:** Smart contracts can be used to automate the transfer of property ownership and title, which can reduce the time and cost of real estate transactions.
**Rental agreements:** Smart contracts can be used to manage rental agreements and payments, which can reduce the risk of disputes and make the rental process more efficient.
**Fractional ownership:** Smart contracts can be used to facilitate fractional ownership of properties, which can make it easier for people to invest in real estate.
